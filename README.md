# Quinar Framework v6.1.2 – Final Academic Bundle

**Hybrid Simulation of Quantum Interference and Gravitational Deformation without Quantum Hardware**

This repository contains the final release of the Quinar Framework (v6.1.2), a research-based simulation environment designed for photon-level quantum interference studies with gravitational effects. It includes validated methods for scaling up simulations without the need for physical quantum hardware.

## What's Included

- Whitepaper (v6.1.1) – scientifically verified
- Android-optimized technical matrix (PDF)
- Technical summary (TXT)
- README and documentation

## Key Features

- Simulates up to 1200 photon-scale interference patterns
- Uses hybrid classical numerical approximation
- Incorporates noise filtering, wavelet analysis, and fragmentation
- Designed for educational, research, and theoretical use
- Fully open-source (MIT License + CC-BY 4.0)
